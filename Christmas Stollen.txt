~ 2 loaves maybe I can't remember.
Original recipe is 4x this recipe and makes 8 loaves or so.

875g Flour
425g Raisin
250ml White Rum (cheap is fine)
250ml Milk
100g Fresh Yeast / ~50g Active Dry Yeast / ~25g Instant Yeast
187.5g Butter
100g Margarine
50g Lard
< 1 Lemon
87.5g Candied Lemon Peel
25g Candied Orange Peel
125g Sugar
40g Vanilla Sugar
187.5g Sweet Almond
57.5g Bitter Almond / (near impossible to get in the US. just use a little almond extract)
7.5g Salt

Night Before:
Mix rum with raisins, stirring every hour or two. Totally fine to just go to sleep and forget about it.
Blanch almonds for 2 minutes (at most) then peel skins and let dry as much as possible, turning over occasionally

Day of:
Bring milk to 105F (or which ever temp is best for your yeast to proof)
Mix yeast with milk thoroughly until dissolved.
    - With this much yeast, it takes a while. Use a whisk for best results.
Make a well in flour on one side of a stupidly large bowl. 
Pour half the yeast/milk mixture in and mix in some of the Flour with hands then finish pouring and mixing until sponge forms. Dont mix in more than 1/3 of the flour. Consistency should be a bit thinner than pudding.
Leaving ~2/3 of the flour not mixed in, cover and let proof until sponge doubles.
While waiting for proof, 
    finely blend 1/2 sweet almonds until they stick to side of blender. Going for a large sand grain texture.
    Chop remaining sweet almonds into larger pieces. ~ 1/4 almond size if not sligtly smaller.
    Zest and juice lemons
    finely grind bitter almonds (ignore this step if using almond extract)
After proofing finishes, mix sugar into yeast sponge (not incorporating too much extra flour)
Add butter, margerine, and lard to sponge (make sure these are room temp or close to 80-90F)
Add lemon juice (Dont add all of it if using very large lemons)
Add lemon Zest
Knead in the remaining flour until fully incorporated
Knead in candied fruits
Add salt and vanilla sugar then knead until incorporated
Add sweet almonds while kneading
Add bitter almonds and knead (dough will unglue from hands) (just kinda wing it with the almond extract. Throw a splash or two in)
Knead in raisins (Dough will get super sticky again due to the rum so have plenty of flour on the side to throw in while kneading.)
    - Only add 1/4 raisins at a time and only add more when fully incorporated. It will look like too many raisins but more raisins is          better.
Dough should not be sticking to hands however it should be tacky. Don't want to add too much flour.
Taste dough and add flour/sugar/salt as needed. 
Scratch dough with a spoon. When the dough tears, it is ready to rise. Or just hope it rises.
Let rise in warm area (75-85F) until doubled (~1hr but go by size not time.)

<<<<<<< HEAD
